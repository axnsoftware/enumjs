enumjs


SUMMARY

enumjs is a module for use with node.

Its singular export, Enum, is both a base class and a factory for you to create
custom enums with.

For now, custom enums do not support anything beyond declaring literal constants.

However, these constants are both instances of and subclasses of the enum class 
that will be created by a call to Enum.create().

Subsequently, these constants can be used in comparisons, switch statements,
and also with the instanceof operator.



USAGE



var Enum = require("enum");
var assert = require("assert");

var EMyEnum = Enum.create( { LIT1 : {}, LIT2 : {} } );


var v = EMyEnum.LIT1;

switch(v) {

	case EMyEnum.LIT1: {
		console.log("matched LIT1");
		break;
	}

	case EMyEnum.LIT2: {
		console.log("matched LIT2");
		break;
	}

	default: {
		throw new Error("no match");
	}
}
